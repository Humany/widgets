# Self-hosting

Self-hosting is an option offered to allow you to take greater control of your widget implementation. This allows you to run your widget related code from your own chosing. By using self-hosting you're in charge of updating your widgets to newer versions since you're not cloud-hosting. That means no breaking changes or unexpected loss of functionality.

Self-hosting boilerplate is available here: [Github Repo](https://github.com/telia-oss/ace-one-widget-self-hosting).
