# Self-hosting

Self-hosting is an option offered to allow you to take greater control of your widget implementation. This allows you to host and serve the widget code from a server of your own choosing. By using self-hosting you're in charge of updating your widgets to newer versions, since you're not using ACE Knowledge cloud-hosting. That means no breaking changes or unexpected loss of functionality.

Self-hosting boilerplate is available here: [Github Repo](https://github.com/telia-oss/ace-one-widget-self-hosting).
